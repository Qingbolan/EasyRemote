# EasyNet: Towards a Decentralized Computing Internet - Research Proposal

## Abstract

Current cloud computing paradigms centralize computational resources within proprietary platforms, requiring data and code migration to vendor-controlled environments. This creates fundamental tensions between computational accessibility and data sovereignty. We propose **EasyNet**, a novel decentralized computing infrastructure that enables global function accessibility while preserving local data ownership and computational autonomy.

EasyNet represents a paradigmatic shift from platform-centric to terminal-centric computing, implementing what we term "Private Function-as-a-Service" (Private FaaS). Our approach demonstrates that global computational accessibility and strict data locality are not mutually exclusive, challenging the prevailing assumption that distributed computing necessitates data centralization.

## 1. Problem Statement and Motivation

### 1.1 The Centralization Paradox in Cloud Computing

Modern cloud computing has created an unprecedented centralization paradox: while computational resources have become globally accessible, they require surrendering data sovereignty and computational autonomy. Current FaaS platforms (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions) operate under a platform-centric model where:

- **Data Migration**: Raw data must be uploaded to vendor-controlled environments
- **Computational Dependency**: Processing occurs on shared, vendor-specified hardware
- **Economic Scaling**: Costs increase superlinearly with computational demand
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Migration barriers create systemic dependencies

### 1.2 The Terminal-Centric Alternative

We propose a fundamental inversion of this paradigm: **terminal-centric computing** where individual devices become the computational substrate while maintaining global accessibility through lightweight coordination mechanisms. This approach addresses three critical limitations of current systems:

1. **Privacy by Design**: Computational logic never leaves the data owner's premises
2. **Resource Utilization**: Leverages existing consumer and prosumer hardware
3. **Economic Efficiency**: Eliminates the platform premium in favor of coordination costs

### 1.3 Research Hypothesis

**Hypothesis**: A decentralized computing network based on terminal-centric architecture can achieve comparable or superior performance to centralized cloud platforms while maintaining strict data locality and reducing computational costs by orders of magnitude.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 The Four Pillars of Terminal-Centric Computing

Our theoretical framework rests on four foundational principles:

1. **Terminal-Centricity**: Computation occurs at the data source
2. **Language-Mediated Interfaces**: Function signatures as universal computational contracts
3. **Function-Level Granularity**: Atomic computational units for maximum flexibility
4. **Trust Boundaries**: Cryptographic verification without data exposure

### 2.2 Architectural Paradigm Comparison

| Dimension | Platform-Centric (Cloud) | **Terminal-Centric (EasyNet)** |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Data Flow** | Source → Platform → Sink | Source ↔ Coordination → Source |
| **Computational Locus** | Vendor Hardware | Owner Hardware |
| **Trust Model** | Platform-Mediated | Cryptographically-Verified |
| **Economic Model** | Usage-Based Rent | Coordination + Contribution |
| **Scaling Mechanism** | Vertical (Platform) | Horizontal (Network) |

### 2.3 Theoretical Contributions

**Contribution 1**: Proof that global computational accessibility does not require data centralization through the introduction of coordination-only gateways.

**Contribution 2**: Demonstration that consumer-grade hardware can provide enterprise-level computational services through proper orchestration.

**Contribution 3**: Evidence that economic efficiency in distributed computing can be achieved through contribution-based rather than consumption-based models.

**Global Access Layer**: Standard protocols (HTTP/gRPC) for universal client compatibility
**Coordination Layer**: Lightweight routing and orchestration without data processing
**Computation Layer**: Heterogeneous terminal devices providing actual computational services

### 3.2 Protocol Design

Our protocol implements a **separation of concerns** between coordination and computation:

- **Coordination Protocol**: Handles discovery, routing, load balancing, and failure recovery
- **Computation Protocol**: Manages function invocation, parameter passing, and result retrieval
- **Security Protocol**: Ensures end-to-end encryption and computational integrity

### 3.3 Key Technical Innovations

1. **Zero-Data Coordination**: Gateways route computational requests without accessing payload data
2. **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Real-time resource awareness and optimal task distribution
3. **Fault-Tolerant Execution**: Automatic retries and alternative routing for high availability

## 7. Conclusion

EasyNet addresses a fundamental tension in modern computing: the choice between computational accessibility and data sovereignty. Our research demonstrates that this is a false dichotomy - properly designed systems can provide global computational access while maintaining strict data locality.

The implications extend beyond technical architecture to encompass economic models, privacy paradigms, and the fundamental relationship between individuals and computational resources. As AI and machine learning become increasingly central to economic activity, the ability to participate in computational networks without surrendering data ownership becomes crucial for maintaining agency in the digital economy.

**Research Significance**: This work provides both theoretical foundations and practical implementations for a new class of distributed computing systems that prioritize user sovereignty while maintaining global accessibility.

**Future Vision**: EasyNet represents the first step toward a computing internet where every device is both a consumer and contributor, where computational resources are as accessible as web pages, and where data ownership and computational accessibility are complementary rather than competing objectives.
